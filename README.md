# Hi, I’m Elaine
## I’m a Data Science student at San Jose State University, passionate about turning data into actionable insights. My journey has involved working on projects in Python, SQL, and Tableau, where I’ve tackled tasks like data analysis, visualization, and database management. I’m excited to connect with others who share an interest in technology, analytics, and problem-solving.
